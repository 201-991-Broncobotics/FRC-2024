# Taylor (Brophy's Version) </br>

**FRC Crescendo Code for Team 991 out of Brophy College Preparatory out of Phoenix, Arizona** </br>
Created using FRC 364's BaseFalconSwerve</br>

**Controller Mappings**
----
This code is natively setup to use a xbox controller to control the swerve drive. </br>
* Left Stick: Translation Control (forwards and sideways movement)
* Right Stick: Rotation Control </br>
* Y button: Zero Gyro (useful if the gyro drifts mid match, just rotate the robot forwards, and press Y to rezero)
* Left Bumper: Switches To Robot Centric Control while held
